# üê≥ Docker Networking: Key Concepts & Practical Guide

## 1. What is Docker Networking?

- How Docker containers communicate with each other, the host machine, and the external network (internet).  
- **Analogy:** Connecting individual "houses" (containers) to each other and the outside world.

---

## 2. Core Networking Drivers:

```
* **Bridge Network (Default):**
    * Mechanism: Docker creates a virtual bridge on the host.
    * Communication: Containers on the same bridge talk to each other by IP.
    * External Access: Via NAT through Docker daemon.
    * Analogy: LAN inside a house.
    * Use Case: Most common, default for single-host applications.

* **Host Network:**
    * Mechanism: Container shares host's network namespace.
    * Communication: No network isolation; container uses host's IP/ports directly.
    * Analogy: Container *is* the host from network perspective.
    * Use Case: Max performance, no isolation needed, direct host port access.

* **None Network:**
    * Mechanism: Container has no network interfaces (only loopback).
    * Communication: Completely isolated.
    * Analogy: House with no network connection.
    * Use Case: Batch jobs not requiring network, explicit network attachment later.

* **Overlay Network (for Swarm Mode):**
    * Mechanism: Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts (distributed network).
    * Analogy: Secure, private channel between houses in different cities.
    * Use Case: Docker Swarm clusters.

* **Macvlan Network:**
    * Mechanism: Container gets its own MAC address and IP from physical network.
    * Analogy: Each container has a "physical" cable to the main switch.
    * Use Case: Containers need to appear as physical devices on the network.
```

## 3. Practical Example: Custom Bridge Network (EC2 Walkthrough)

```
* Goal: Demonstrate communication between two containers using a custom bridge network on an EC2 instance.
* Scenario: `webserver` (Nginx) and `client` (curl) containers.

* Steps:
    1.  EC2 Setup: Launch Ubuntu EC2, allow SSH (Port 22), HTTP (Port 80) in Security Group.
    2.  Install Docker: Standard Docker installation steps for Ubuntu.
        - sudo apt update
        - Install dependencies.
        - Add Docker GPG key & repo.
        - sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io...
        - sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu (then `newgrp docker` or relogin).
    3.  Create Custom Bridge Network:
        - Command: docker network create my-app-network
        - Purpose: Provides isolation and built-in DNS resolution.
        - Verify: docker network ls
    4.  Run Nginx (Webserver) Container:
        - Command: docker run -d --name webserver --network my-app-network -p 80:80 nginx:latest
        - --name webserver: Essential for inter-container communication by name.
        - --network my-app-network: Connects to our custom network.
        - -p 80:80: Maps host port 80 to container port 80 for *external* access.
        - Verify: Access EC2 Public IP in browser.
    5.  Run Client Container & Test Communication:
        - Command: docker run --rm --network my-app-network alpine/git sh -c "apk add curl && curl http://webserver"
        - --rm: Auto-removes container on exit.
        - --network my-app-network: CRUCIAL for inter-container comm.
        - curl http://webserver: Key point! Using container name (`webserver`) for DNS resolution provided by Docker on the custom network.
        - Expected Output: Nginx HTML content.
    6.  Clean Up:
        - docker stop webserver
        - docker rm webserver
        - docker network rm my-app-network
```

## 4. Key Takeaways from Example:

```
* Custom Bridge Networks: Provide isolated, internal communication for services.
* Service Discovery by Name: Containers on the same custom bridge network can resolve each other by their --name (DNS resolution). No need for IP addresses.
* Port Mapping (-p): For *external* access (host to container). Not needed for *internal* container-to-container communication on the same custom network.
```

---

## 5. Further Exploration:

```
* Docker Compose: For defining and managing multi-container applications (auto-creates custom bridge networks).
* --network host: Experiment with host networking.
* docker network inspect <network_name>: View detailed network info (IPs, containers).
* docker inspect <container_name>: View specific container's network settings.
```

---

## 6. Inspecting Container Networking in Action

```
* Check Container IP Address:
    docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container_name>
    Useful when debugging connectivity issues.
```

---

## 7. Common Troubleshooting Tips

```
* Container can't reach another?
    - Check if they're on the same network.
    - Validate container names with docker ps.
    - Use docker network inspect and docker inspect for clues.

* Can't access app from browser?
    - Verify EC2 Security Group allows inbound traffic on required ports.
    - Use public IP of EC2 instance.
    - Ensure container is running and port is exposed with -p.

* "Connection refused" errors?
    - Often due to incorrect port mapping or service not started.

## 8. Real-World Use Cases Comparison Table

| Network Type | Use Case Example                            | Isolation | Performance |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Bridge       | Web app + DB on same host                   | Medium    | Good        |
| Host         | Monitoring agent like Prometheus            | Low       | Best        |
| None         | Script-only container (no networking)       | High      | N/A         |
| Overlay      | Microservices in Swarm across hosts         | Medium    | Medium      |
| Macvlan      | IoT simulation or legacy apps needing IPs   | Low       | Good        |
